                       Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations

Project Overview

                        Support operations often struggle with delays and inefficiencies due to manual ticket assignment, misrouted issues, and uneven workload distribution among agents. This project aims to design and implement an automated ticket assignment system that ensures faster resolution, optimized resource utilization, and improved customer satisfaction.

Objectives

Automate ticket categorization and assignment based on priority, expertise, and availability.

Reduce resolution time by routing tickets to the most appropriate support agent/team.

Minimize SLA breaches by ensuring urgent tickets are handled promptly.

Improve transparency in ticket workflows with monitoring dashboards.

Ensure scalability for high ticket volumes.

Scope

Ticket classification (by issue type, priority, SLA).
                   
Intelligent routing (rule-based + workload balancing).

Escalation handling.

Reporting & dashboards for managers.

Out-of-Scope (initial phase):

Chatbot integrations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
System Workflow

                       Step 1: Ticket Creation

                                    User raises a ticket via portal, email, or chat.

                       Step 2: Automatic Classification

                                     System scans ticket metadata:

                                      Keywords (issue type).

                                     Customer profile.

                                      SLA priority.

                     Step 3: Assignment Engine

                                    Rule-based logic + workload check:

                                    Assign to agent/team with the right skillset.

                                  Distribute evenly across available agents.

                                Consider agent workload (open vs resolved tickets).


                    Step 4: Escalation Handling

                                  If SLA breach is near â†’ auto-escalate to higher tier.

                   Step 5: Monitoring & Reporting

                                 Managers track performance with dashboards:

                                Ticket volume.

                               SLA compliance.

                                Agent productivity.
